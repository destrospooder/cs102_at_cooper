# Session 11: Putting our C skills to use...

## Topics to cover
1. Understanding a struct, what is a union?

### Union
K&R define a union as, "a variable that may hold (at different times) objects of different types and sizes, with the compiler keeping track of size and alignment requirements. Unions provide a way to manipulate different kinds of data in a single area of storage [addressed in memory], without embedding any machine-depedent information in the program."

See code in ```src``` directory
